#### As an application hoster I want to add user authentication to my application.

- [ ] Users can sign up.
- [ ] Users can log in after they've signed up.
- [ ] Users can log out after logging in.
- [ ] Users can choose to be remembered after logging in.
- [ ] Multiple browsers can concurrently hold permanent cookies.
- [ ] Logged in users should not be able to register, nor log in again.

__Note__: Do not use Devise for this task.

Discussion topics:
- [ ] If we wanted to add more advanced features such as email activation and
  "forgot my password", should we continue to "roll our own" authentication?
