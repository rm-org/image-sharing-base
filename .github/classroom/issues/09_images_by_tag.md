#### As a user I want to view all images associated with a tag.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] When I click on a tag, I see a filtered list of only the images that have
  the tag I clicked on.
- [ ] The tag name (not its ID) is used to perform the filtering.

Discussion topics:
- [ ] Where should we implement this functionality?
- [ ] What happens if a user tries to manually filter by a nonexistent tag?

Dependencies:
- Image Tags
